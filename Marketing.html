      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>We are Adira, a brand for and by women. In 2022, we are still living in a society where everything is arranged to the advantage of men. We believe that women should be empowered to feel confident and stand up for themselves, because only then diversity can furtherly innovate and be equalized.
Our message is that Adira will provide women with the courage and confidence they need to become self-sufficient and successful in a world where it is not simple.
</p>
      <p>Our primary promotional activity has been through social media. We have been promoting our product on two separate social media platforms: Instagram and Tiktok. On our Instagram platform, you can view a range of posts, stories, and short fragments known as reels; these diverse adverts add variety to our feed. On our tik tok platform, you may also watch various short videos with viral music.</p>

		 <p>To start with, millennial women spend the majority of their time on Instagram and Tiktok, sometimes more than two hours each day. They meet a lot of new brands through these platforms, as these brands also utilize Instagram and Tiktok for promotion. 
</p>
      <p>Secondly, Instagram's engagement rate is higher than any other social media platform's engagement rate. Instagram allows users to create reels, stories, and posts, all of which can be readily shared with other Instagram users. And instead of tracking followers, likes, or comments, Instagram evaluates the effectiveness of your campaign based on awareness, reach, and recall. 
</p>
		<p> Furthermore, Tiktok is also one of the biggest social media platforms nowadays. Making video ads that are based on daily trends increases their relevancy and likelihood to show on someone’s For you page. On tiktok you can go viral very fast. Another great way to use TikTok to increase brand awareness is by going live. And there are different ad formats to choose from when advertising on Tiktok. 
 </p>
		<p> As a result, we are sure that these objectives are feasible and attainable by the end of April 8th, 2022. 
 </p>
