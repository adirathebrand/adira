      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>We are Adira, a brand for and by women. In 2022, we are still living in a society where everything is arranged to the advantage of men. We believe that women should be empowered to feel confident and stand up for themselves, because only then diversity can furtherly innovate and be equalized.
Our message is that Adira will provide women with the courage and confidence they need to become self-sufficient and successful in a world where it is not simple.
</p>
      <p>Our primary promotional activity has been through social media. We have been promoting our product on two separate social media platforms: Instagram and Tiktok. On our Instagram platform, you can view a range of posts, stories, and short fragments known as reels; these diverse adverts add variety to our feed. On our tik tok platform, you may also watch various short videos with viral music.</p>

		 <p>To start with, millennial women spend the majority of their time on Instagram and Tiktok, sometimes more than two hours each day. They meet a lot of new brands through these platforms, as these brands also utilize Instagram and Tiktok for promotion. 
</p>
      <p>Secondly, Instagram's engagement rate is higher than any other social media platform's engagement rate. Instagram allows users to create reels, stories, and posts, all of which can be readily shared with other Instagram users. And instead of tracking followers, likes, or comments, Instagram evaluates the effectiveness of your campaign based on awareness, reach, and recall. 
</p>
		<p> Furthermore, Tiktok is also one of the biggest social media platforms nowadays. Making video ads that are based on daily trends increases their relevancy and likelihood to show on someone’s For you page. On tiktok you can go viral very fast. Another great way to use TikTok to increase brand awareness is by going live. And there are different ad formats to choose from when advertising on Tiktok. 
 </p>
		<p> When looking back at our objectives, we estimated half of them correctly. For our reach objective, we have had more than 2000 views on our Instagram reels but we did not reach 1000 views on Tiktok. We did reach our affect objective, as we got a lot of positive and curious messages and comments. For our response objective, our posts were not shared enough unfortunately. 
 </p>

		 <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
            <p>We have faced some ups and downs throughout the project, which is a good thing. The ups kept us going, and the downs taught us a lesson. The main thing we learned is that we are all in this project together and that we must be able to rely on each other as teammates. We need to divide tasks, work on them, take responsibility and complete them on time. 
</p>
		<p> Our marketing campaign went very smoothly, but there were still a few difficulties that we encountered and learned from. Firstly, it was hard to determine our objectives. At first we went by our gut feeling, but we soon found out that we actually had to do research into similar brands as Adira. We definitely learned from this. Secondly, we had started out with a rather free and loose schedule for posting, but after two days, we realized that this did not work for us. We tightened our schedule and immediately posting went a lot better. This is something we will keep in mind for our next campaign. 
 </p>
		<p> We are still very happy with the chosen target group, as they make our brand. The young women, who seek support to stand up for themselves. That's what Adira gives them, support and confidence. The two social media platforms, Instagram and Tik tok, also fit this target group perfectly. We have received a lot of views and positive responses. This worked really well for us. 
 </p>
		<p> For the future, we would do more research for our objectives from the beginning and start by making a tight schedule for our social media posts. 
 </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>We have come a long way with our campaign already. We started defining our target group, objectives and started thinking of our media tactics, which platforms would fit us best and why? This needed some research of course. When we had everything worked out, we got started with the planning. We brainstormed a lot; What kind of posts are we going to make? How can we attract the attention of our target group? What kind of feed and atmosphere do we want to create? When is the best time to post? We made a schedule with what and when to post and this went very good.</p>
      <p>If the campaign would continue from this point, we would set the objectives a bit lower, as we are a starting brand. The people still need to get to know us and what we stand for, this takes a little more time than we thought. Furthermore, we would also set a tighter schedule from the beginning. This would make sure we post at least one thing each day. 
</p>
      <p>For the future, we would start by defining our target group, objectives and think of what social media platforms we will be using. We would do some research and watch brands with the same vision and message as ours. Then we would work out our media tactics based on our research. Moreover, we would start by making our posts, reels, stories and Tiktok fragments. Then we would make the planning about when we want to post everything. When people get to know our brand and are curious, we would like to go bigger and advertise on tv as well.</p>
